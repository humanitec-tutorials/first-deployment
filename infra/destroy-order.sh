# SAFE DESTRUCTION SCRIPT FOR HUMANITEC TUTORIAL INFRASTRUCTURE
# =============================================================================
#
# This script safely destroys the Humanitec tutorial infrastructure with:
# - Environment-first destruction to prevent dependency issues
# - Proper error handling if environments cannot be deleted
# - Simplified approach leveraging Terraform lifecycle dependencies
#
# DESTRUCTION ORDER:
# 1. Destroy environments first (critical dependency)
# 2. If environments destroy successfully, proceed with full terraform destroy
# 3. If environments fail to destroy, halt and report the issue
#
